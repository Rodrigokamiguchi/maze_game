# About

It is a maze game developed in Python using the Pygame library. The practices used include object-oriented programming, featuring levels from 1 to 20, with potential expansion in the future. Starting from level 10, monsters and doors begin to appear. The game includes a scoring system based on the speed with which a player completes the maze at a given level.

The pink dots are monsters, the golden ones are the doors, and the yellow ones are the keys to open the doors.
